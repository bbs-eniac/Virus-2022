				<h1>br&ltAI&gtnstorm</h1>
				<p>Artificial intelligence, though old as a concept, is the future of the world of technology.
					It is a revolutionary discipline that involves cognitive functions like learning, problem solving,
					reasoning, etc. AI can timelapse the world to the era of technology , the "ERA OF THE - Z" and we are looking for ideas that
					echo with brilliance and an urge to make this world a better place to live in.</p>

						<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
						<p>Machine learning refers to algorithms resolving the data into components, learning from that
							data, and then applying the learning to make informed decisions. This technique, which is
							often simply referred to as AI, is used in many services that offer automated
							recommendations. Machine learning fuels all sorts of automated tasks that span across
							multiple industries. Machine learning involves a lot of complex math and coding. "Machine
							learning" is the ability that allows a machine to perform a function with the data given to
							it and get progressively better over time.</p>

						<h2>Deep Learning</h2>
						<p>Deep learning is basically an evolution of machine learning. It uses a programmable neural
							network that allows machines to make accurate decisions. It can be said that a deep learning
							model is able to learn through its own method of computing. A deep learning model is
							designed to continually analyze data with a logic structure similar to how a human would
							draw conclusions. For this very purpose, deep learning applications use a layered structure
							of algorithms called an artificial neural network. It requires a lot of training to get the
							learning processes correct.</p>
